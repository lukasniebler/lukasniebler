# My ride into WordPress webdevelopment

- 👋 Hi, I’m Lukas
- 💻 I love Webdesign, User Experience Design and Microbiology (and WordPress)
- 🖥 Currently working at Regionales Rechenzentrum Erlangen (RRZE) as (Junior Junior) Webdeveloper and CMS manager

## About me:
- 🌱 I've graduated with a BS in Biology. That's also the reason why I love Microbiology, Structural and Pharmaceutical biology. (I told you my path is rather bumpy)
- 🌖 I work with charities in my spare time, to improve their print- and webdesign. I also manage our local church's WordPress site. (That's how I got started on my WP Dev journey)
- 🌊 My other hobbies: Corporate Design | Logo Design | Illustration | ( 3D Animation ) || Playing the flute (At least one almost normal thing on my list 🐷)
- 💡 Stuff I like: Studio Ghibli | Watching Netflix | ( & Drawing - If there is time left )

- 🎯 My goals this year: Dive deeper into Wp Development and additionally to learn React
